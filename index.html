            <h1> Andrew's super cool new site</h1>
        <p>Hello! This is my website to help me learn the ins and outs of git version control as well is HTML and CSS programming for website development. 
            There is no real plan or anything for whats going to be added, but it will help me gain the experience needed to add CSS and HTML to my resume</p>
            <br>
        </header>

        <p>
            This website is hosted right now through github's static webpage hosting service. 
            In the future, If it becomes big enough, I will buy my own domain name and maybe even move off of guthub and try to host it myself.
            I have plans to add some type of backend databse to help learn how that works, even if it just stores basic things.
        </p>

        <p> Heres a list of some planned features:</p>
        <ol class ="lists">
            <li>Other web pages</li>
            <li>Cool CSS effects and styles</li>
            <li>imbeded videos</li>
            <li><s>Dark and light mode toggle</s></li>
            <li>live page visit counter</li>
        </ol>
